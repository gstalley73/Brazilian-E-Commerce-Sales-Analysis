Key Insights 

Revenue grew steadily month over month between 2016 and 2018, with seasons being a clear factor as well.
Beauty Supplies and Gift Watches led product category revenue, while other categories also generated notable sales, with three additional categories posting above-average revenue.
Credit cards are the most common payment type, generating both the highest total revenue and the highest average payment value, while vouchers rank lowest in both metrics, which is expected, as vouchers typically represent a fixed amount.
On average, deliveries are completed in about 13 days,  roughly twice as fast as the estimated delivery time.
Revenue is concentrated in a handful of states, led by São Paulo (SP), which is unsurprising given that it’s the most populous state in Brazil.
Top sellers account for a significant share of total sales, yet other sellers continue to serve a large customer base.
Installments vs. Single payments are split almost completely in half, but Installments edge out Single payments slightly at 51%. This is probably because installments are very common in Brazil when compared to countries like the US.
